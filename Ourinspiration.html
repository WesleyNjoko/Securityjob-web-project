<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size=30px; text-shadow: 4px 4px 8px #666;">OUR INSPIRATION:</h1>


<P style="text-align: center;font-size=20px; text-shadow: 4px 4px 8px #666;">
The biggest issue in our context is, there are lot of sources even here in the cyber space that are expressing themselves in providing people with some job availability, to enable someone in getting a job! For a matter of practical example, the Security job network has directed hundreds of officers to their destined job and when they arrive there to market themselves, the company is surely hiring(unless there were unforeseen changes)
</P>
<P style="text-align: center;font-size=20px; text-shadow: 4px 4px 8px #666;">
<li>Firstly, the CEO of this network had once worked in a security department, so he knows exactly what information needed to a security officer when hunting for a job. The officer wants to go there if and only if they want people and what officers' qualification they need. Once that information is a guaranteed one, the officer can continue the journey of hunting!
</li>
</P>

<P style="text-align: center;font-size=20px; text-shadow: 4px 4px 8px #666;">
<li> Secondly, In observing the ecosystem of highly economically imbalanced country like RSA, these jobs like a security department one, are the one you can easily get without any bribery, inheritance connection or relativity connection (for as long you have the required qualifications of the industry).
</li>
